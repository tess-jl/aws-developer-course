# Section 16: AWS Serverless: SAM (Serverless Application Model)
-how we do manage our serverless app? could use cloudformation but it's complicated--> instead, SAM 
-SAM = shortcut to cloudformation (YAML files)

### SAM Overview
-**SAM (Serverless Application Model)** = serverless development framework used to write and deploy serverless apps
* all config = YAML CloudFormation code
* supports anything that CloudFormation uses (outputs, mappings, params, resources, etc.)
* 2 commands to deploy to AWS 
* SAM can use CodeDeploy to deploy Lambda functions
* SAM helps us run Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB locally (therefore don't need to deploy lambda function to test)

SAM Recipe 
* **Transform Header** = what indicates it's a SAM template --> e.g. Transform: Serverless-2018-10-31
--> this transform header **indicates how this SAM file should be transformed into much more complex cloudformation YAML** 
* 3 resources see: 
1. AWS::Serverless::Function --> Lambda
1. AWS::Serverless::Api --> API Gateway
1. AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable --> DynamoDB
* package with cloudfomration package or **sam package**
* deploy with cloudformation deploy or **sam deploy** 

**change set** = how cloudformation should take the existing state and move it to next state based on modifications

### Installing the SAM CLI 
https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli
can install a nice CLI to develop locally via aws-sam-cli --> see corresponding GitHub 
* need Docker, Python, AWS CLI 
* use python to install CLI 

### Creating First SAM Project
```
sam init
```
creates a lot of files for us but need to specify a lot 

Instead can do it file by file: 
look at examples: https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-app-examples 
-need tample.yaml, app.py, and commands.sh 

### Deploying SAM Project 
-adding to commands.sh file --> need to specify the S3 bucket, template file, output template file
-run commands in CLI 
aws cloudformation = sam package 

NOW code auto updated by cloudformation package to point to the right S3 bucket --> check bucket to see that file was uploaded! 
NOW use CodeDeploy --> creates change set --> change set fails b/c need to add a capability 
```
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```
NOW stack should be in cloudformation --> check right region --> can see that this stack is being created --> see that function and IAM role created --> can also see lambda function deployed!

### SAM API Gateway 
-need to modify template.yaml to add API Gateway configuration 
-change lambda function too 
-check example on GitHub for microservice endpoint
NOW a lot more resources created for us automatically 
see API Gateway --> see the API and the endpoints --> test and now see error --> now can redeploy from CLI and can then re-test

### SAM DynamoDB 
-adding a DynamoDb to this makes our app fully serverless 
-create client outside of the handler 
-update the template.yaml to make a simple DynamoDB table
-need to give lambda function access to table --> need to add IAM policies to do this

-update handler so that it does a scans the table and returns the scan result
-redeploy 
-cloudformation shows that dynamoDB table was also created!
-check that lambda function works properly (see that envs there, IAM roles there (role allows lambda access to the table's associated APIs))
-test the lambda function and it works 

### SAM CloudFormation Designer and Application Repository 
-power of using SAM = much more simple than CloudFormation
-see all the events different
-see the actual template in CloudFormation 
-look at CloudFormation Designer to see what was generated by CloudFormation via SAM!
**SAM = way to deploy lambda function!** 

**Serverless Application Repository = templates made by people, SAM packages! see an actual SAM template here!**
