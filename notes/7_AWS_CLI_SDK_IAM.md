# Section 7: AWS CLI, SDK, IAM Roles and Policies 
-So far we've manually interacted with services to see standard info (all but S3)
1. How do we develop against AWS without using the online console? reduce manual experience 
1. How do we interact with AWS proprietary services (S3, DynamoDB, etc)

Can be done in serveral ways: 
* AWS CLI on local computer 
* AWS CLI on EC2 machine 
* AWS SDK on local computer 
* AWS SDK on EC2 machin
* AWS Instance Metadata Service for EC2
