# Section 13: AWS Serverless: Lambda 
-new paradigm 
-Lambda = one of the most widely-used and popular, revolutionized how deploy, scale, make apps 

### Serverless Intro 
**serverless** = new paradigm in which developers don't manage servers --> developers deploy code.. functions! 
* initially serverless = **FaaS** (Function as a service) 
* now, serverless = anything that doesn't require servers 
* most of the time in AWS serverless = lambda
* **serverless != no servers... just that don't manage, provision, see them**

Serverless in AWS 
* Lambda and Step Functions 
* DynamoDB
* Cognito 
* API Gateway 
* S3
* SNS and SQS
* Kinesis 
* Aurora serverless (RDS but without creating a server)

AWS takes care of server architecture management for all of them :)
